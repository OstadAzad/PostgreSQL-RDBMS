                       Name of the student
department_id
                       Foreign key referencing departments table
last_login
                       Last login date

departments Table Structure:
Column Name
                       Description
id
                       Auto-incremented primary key
name

courses Table Structure:
Column Name
                       Description

Date & Grouping Tasks (Based on 9-1, 9-2)
Retrieve students who have logged in within the last 30 days.


Extract the login month from the last_login and group students by month.


Count how many students logged in per month and show only those months where login count is more than 3.



Foreign Key & Constraints (Based on 9-3, 9-4, 9-5)
Create a foreign key constraint on department_id in the students table referencing departments(id).


Try inserting a student with a department_id that doesnâ€™t exist and observe the behavior.


Delete a department and see how students are affected using ON DELETE CASCADE and ON DELETE SET NULL.



Join Operations (Based on 9-6 to 9-8)
Join students and departments using INNER JOIN to display each student's department name.


Use a LEFT JOIN to show all students including those without a department.


Use a RIGHT JOIN to show all departments including those without students.


Perform a FULL JOIN to get all records from both students and departments.


Create a cross-product of all students and courses using CROSS JOIN.


Use NATURAL JOIN between tables that have a shared column like department_id.
